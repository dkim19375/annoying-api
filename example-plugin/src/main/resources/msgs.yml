# These are placeholders that can be used in any message in this file
# This is extremely useful for things like prefixes, color schemes, and more
# Using a global placeholder is just like any other placeholder! Simply surround the placeholder name with "%" (ex: "%prefix%")
# WARNING: Global placeholders can conflict with local placeholders! Please be wary when creating your own global placeholder(s)!
placeholders: # It's recommended to keep all the default global placeholders (prefix, p, s, pe, se)
  prefix: "&7&lTEST &8&l| &7" # Prefix for the plugin, typically used in the beginning of most messages
  p: "&b" # Base color for non-error messages
  s: "&3" # Highlight color for non-error messages
  pe: "&c" # Base color for error messages
  se: "&4" # Highlight color for error messages

splitter:
  # This is the splitter for the JSON components (see above). Default: "@@"
  json: "@@"
  # This is the splitter for the placeholders. Default: "=="
  placeholder: "=="
